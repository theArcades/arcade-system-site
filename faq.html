      <h2>...So I'm Plural.</h2>
      <p>
        I experience Dissociative Identity Disorder and identify as plural.
        There are a bunch of individuals sharing space in my head, and we work
        together to function as a system. If you're meeting me at work or at a
        large gathering, you wouldn't know about this. But when I'm not spending
        spoons on putting on a good social performance I forget large chunks of
        day to day life, I space out pretty badly when asked to switch contexts,
        and my personality changes based on which alter is fronting at the time.
        Everything else on this page is just details about what that all means.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we know this is a lot to take in. The first time we met a system it
        was hard for us to parse their experiences. We hope this answers some of
        your most common questions. We also link out to some of our favorite
        videos and resources on the DID experience.
      </p>

      <h2>The short version</h2>
      <p>
        ✅We are the Arcade System, or the Arcades. Naming a system is a
        community tradition that helps to separate our identity from the trauma
        that made us into a multiple.<br /><br />
        ✅When talking about our system, we use we/us pronouns to indicate that
        we're talking about the system as a whole.<br /><br />
        ✅The members of the system take turns "fronting," or controlling the
        body<br /><br />
        ✅If you are willing, it is polite to ask who is in front when we meet
        up - it lets us know that you are willing to see and respect the system
        members as individuals<br /><br />
        ✅If you know who is fronting, use their name, but Austen will always be
        fine <br /><br />
        ✅System members don't always have access to every experience we've ever
        had together, so please consider that when we talk. The current fronter
        may respond with "I wasn't there for that," which means they can't
        access the memory of that event. They may need a moment to ask around in
        the system to remember what you're talking about. ask someone inside to
        shair their memory. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h2>Why DID?</h2>
      <p>
        Dissociative Identity Disorder is a last-ditch defense mechanism used by
        children growing up within inescapable and overwhelming trauma. A child
        given no other escape route to an overwhelming stressor may choose to
        separate the trauma behind amnesiac barriers so that they can continue
        to function. Over time, these segregated parts grow, learn, and change
        alongside the "host" personality, adopting different identities,
        genders, likes, dislikes, and goals. (And if you want to know what
        happened to us, specifically, please don't ask. We don't like sharing
        that, and thinking about it may trigger PTSD flashbacks.)
      </p>

      <h2>Why the Arcades?</h2>
      <p>
        Arcades were the safest and happiest place we would go to while growing
        up, so we decided to name our collective after them. The multiple
        community created the system naming tradition to separate the system -
        the group of alters in a DID brain - from the stigma and trauma of what
        made the system exist. It also helps us to define ourselves in a more
        deliberate way than "Austen, who has voices in their head."
      </p>
      <h2>"...so you're Austen and the alters, right?"</h2>
      <p>
        Not quite. No one in the system is named Austen, but we all respond to
        that name. (Think of it like an API, or a catch-all term for the
        system.) We used to have a system member who went by Austen but they
        changed their name out of respect of the system. <br /><br />
        By way of explanation, we don't want folks to see any one of us as the
        "real" one. There is no original, no main alter, and each alter exists
        for a reason. We are a team, and we succeed when we work as a leaderless
        cooperative.
      </p>
      <h2>"What should I do if you dissociate?"</h2>
      <p>
        Dissociation often presents as confusion, an inability to talk, and a
        trance-like state for us. We probably have to talk to folks inside and
        find out who needs what. If you know of a quiet place where we can go to
        collect ourselves, please let us know. We usually use grounding tools
        like fidget toys, strong scents, and grounding exercises to interrupt
        dissociation.
      </p>

      <h2>
        "I have a question but don't want to offend / ask stupid questions /
        make you uncomfortable-"
      </h2>
      <p>
        Please, <i>please</i> ask us! This gets covered in one of The
        Alexandrite System's videos we link below but when you ask questions it
        lets us know that 1) you want to engage with the system as a system and
        2) you aren't just dismissing this as a weird... <i>thing</i> we're
        doing for a laugh. This is a big part of who we are now; last thing we
        want you to feel about our system is that it's too bizarre or too
        difficult to engage with. <br /><br />
        ...Besides, we're trans. belive us when we say that you can't come close
        to asking the most embarrassing or terrible question we've ever heard.
