      <p>
        The project management enby of the system. Sometimes I'm silly;
        sometimes I'm practical, but I always have a checklist and work hard to
        get it all done. I used to go by Addie but have been slowly changing over to Aura after a few breakthroughs in my own journey.

      <p>
        I came to be in the system in our late teens when we realized we were
        very very trans. Did a lot of the initial exploration of gender for the
        system and went to school for part of our freshman year of college. I
        handle self-care for the system, both in chores and emotional health. I'm also a bit of a gossip.

        chances to get better.

        I protect the system from harm. I'm assertive, no-nonsense, and if there's a disagreement I will hold everyone's feet to the fire until it is resolved. Vincent and myself tend to maintain the system boundaries, both at work and in our personal life.

        If my voice drops super low and we're curtly pinning people down with pointed questions, you've probably met me. My facilitation style is a bit colder and more assertive than the others.

      <h3>Hit me up if you want to...</h3>
      <p>
        Play fighting games or anything competitive. If you need someone firm to help facilitate a solution to a problem, I'm your guy.
